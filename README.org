* Talk to i3 from a Chrome extension

Uses
[[http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging][Native Messaging]]
to communicate with the
[[http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html][i3 IPC interface]].

** Installing

1. In [[chrome://extensions]] (with developer mode turned on):
   - click the "Load unpacked extension..." button, and
   - navigate to this directory.
   This must be done first to get an ID assigned to the extension.

2. Run ./[[file:Install]], which will:
   - grab the extension ID from the browser preferences,
   - write a NativeMessagingHosts manifest that hooks the
     extension ID to the [[file:Trampoline]], and
   - download [[http://d3js.org][D3.js]].

** Playing Around

The extension adds a "browser button" with the i3 logo.
Click it to get a drop-down menu:
   - boxyTree :: renders the i3 tree to HTML tables.
